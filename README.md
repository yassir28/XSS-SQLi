# Detection of malicious injections using deep learing
This is an academical project that my classmate Ayman DIAI and I made in the in order to detect the malicious injections such as XSS and SQLi that bypass the traditional filters because of SQL language's structure. We tried to build a smart model that analyses a incoming request from a user and detect if it is clean (Human inputs : passwords, comments, emails, etc..) or malicious ( xss payload, sql injection payload ). The architecture of the model we chose contains LSTM neural network that can deal well with text. In general, the model works well ( check confusion confusion matrix) especially for  detection of sql injections. We only have to improve the detection of xss because of the is rarity of xss data to train, so we are are trying to use some new skills such as: focal loss and transfer learning, etc.. to solve this small problem.
